# Security Policy

This repository is part of a **personal portfolio**. The code is educational/demonstrative and is not tied to any production service.

## How to Report
- **Private (recommended):** In this repo, use **Security → Report a vulnerability** to submit the report privately.  
- **If you don’t see that option:** open an **Issue** with the title **`Security: request private contact`** *without technical details*. I’ll then invite you to a private **Security Advisory** for further discussion.

> **Do not publish PoC or sensitive data** in public spaces (Issues/PRs).

## Scope
- Applies only to the **code and configurations** within this repository.  
- Third-party services and environments not controlled by this project are out of scope.  

## Handling

Security reports are not actively monitored or handled.  
No fixes or mitigations should be expected.  

## Keys/Secrets
- Do not include real secrets in Issues/PRs.  
- If you discover exposed credentials, please report it privately so they can be rotated/removed.
